In this repository, I have attempted to recreate certain (with limited) aspects of git in shell script, with its own name being girt. There are also 9 tests shell scripts that each test a specific function/aspect of girt.

Specifically, I have created girt-init, girt-add, girt-log, girt-commit, girt-rm, girt-show and girt-status which attempt to performance functions of git (with certain limitations).

This entire project was created as part of the UNSW course COMP2041 - Software Construction as an assignment.
